# Nomster

Nomster is a web application built for users to upload new or old restaurants they have eaten at for others to comment on or read comments on to see the experiences others have had at the restaurant. Once a restaurant is uploaded, it will show users the name, address, and the location via google maps. 

# Getting Started

Navigate over to https://nomster-nacoda-waschalk.herokuapp.com/ to start viewing restaurant reviews. If you would like to create your own post, simply click on the drop down menu located at the top right of the home page and choose the option to "Sign Up". Once you created your profile you can then click on "New Place" from the drop down menu to create your first review. You will be asked to enter a "Name", "Address", and a "Description" of the restaurant. Voila! You have now uploaded a new place where others can share their comments and experiences on.
